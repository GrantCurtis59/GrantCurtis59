  <h1>The Steel Curtain</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Steel Curtain</strong> was the nickname given to the legendary
    defensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 1970s. It is widely
    considered one of the greatest defenses in NFL history.
  </p>

  <h2>Origin of the Name</h2>
  <p>
    The name “Steel Curtain” comes from Pittsburgh’s strong ties to the steel
    industry and was inspired by the term “Iron Curtain.” It symbolized how
    difficult it was for opposing teams to break through the Steelers’ defense.

  <h2>Legacy</h2>

    championships in the 1970s. Its dominance changed how defenses were built
    and is still referenced as a benchmark for defensive excellence today.
